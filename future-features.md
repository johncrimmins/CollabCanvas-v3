- Basic agent can do the basic commands - need to meet gauntlet reqs first
- Add text layer for annotations
- TheN add some of the advanced features like undo and stuff for more foundational basics, layers etc
- At this point setup v-test and chrome dev tools mcp for regular testing including e2e
    - get it production ready before adding innovations below
- Add ability to drag and drop images
- Then add complexity to the agent a bit more - as in the doc
    - make sure its production-ready for agent usage; have guardrails / boundaries to avoid security issues with the agent or over-use of the API
- Add comments and comment threads from users - attach them to shapes and show a little visual indicator that there is a comment as the number of comments (if >9 just say 9+) and the comments appear on a nice little bubble modal that’s easily scrollable to see what your collaborators are saying about that piece
- Then polish the app and brand it The LookBook (nod to fb and z was insistent on The for some reason), model-esque high fashion collaborative vibes but plenty of white space on the canvas - ask Zaina and ai to think through how the layout should look, if creative modeling team meeting in person how would they want it? Maybe a pinnable board w white papers and some depth on the screen for ui? Or just simple basic canvas to ensure it performs well
    - Polish elements
    - Toolbar for shapes and shit shows up on left only if you hover over there or pin it to the sidebar
- 
- Add landing page on brand
    - Ask lovable or bolt to do that they’re great w landing pages
    - Feed it the brand from ChatGPT (brand guidelines, voice, style guide for site, etc) - do it however airbnb does it in terms of design system, but less complicated / verbose (extract principles and key elements)
- Add stripe checkout and freemium model - you can use it for up to 2 weeks before it asks you to pay (2 weeks to plan & execute one whole shoot cycle)
- Then add the Pinterest api search embedded react component for drag & droppable stuff
    - If we get there, let the agent curate for you and you can see its choices in realtime on the page
    - Def have the Reinforcement learning thumbs up / down if you do that
