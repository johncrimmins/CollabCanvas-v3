# Task List: AI Multi-User Testing & Validation

## Relevant Files

- `src/features/ai-agent/services/simpleAgentService.ts` - Review stateless design
- `src/features/ai-agent/hooks/useAIAgent.ts` - Review user context passing
- `src/features/ai-agent/lib/aiAgentStore.ts` - Review client-side chat storage
- `src/features/objects/services/objectsService.ts` - Review sync mechanisms
- `docs/ai-multi-user-test-report.md` - CREATE: Document test results and findings

### Notes

- This is primarily a testing/validation PRD, not feature development
- No code changes expected unless bugs are found
- Focus on creating comprehensive test scenarios and documentation
- Deliverable is a test report with findings and metrics

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Setup Multi-User Test Environment
  - [ ] 1.1 Create 2+ test user accounts in Firebase Auth
  - [ ] 1.2 Open 2-3 browser windows (or different browsers) with different users
  - [ ] 1.3 Ensure all users can join the same LookBook
  - [ ] 1.4 Verify presence system shows all users online
  - [ ] 1.5 Prepare test commands list for each scenario

- [ ] 2.0 Test Chat Isolation
  - [ ] 2.1 User A: Send command "Create a red circle"
  - [ ] 2.2 User B: Send command "Create a blue square"
  - [ ] 2.3 Verify User A's chat shows only their conversation
  - [ ] 2.4 Verify User B's chat shows only their conversation
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify no cross-contamination of messages
  - [ ] 2.6 Document results in test report

- [ ] 3.0 Test Concurrent AI Usage
  - [ ] 3.1 Both users send AI commands simultaneously
  - [ ] 3.2 Verify both commands execute successfully
  - [ ] 3.3 Verify both objects appear on both canvases
  - [ ] 3.4 Measure object sync latency (should be < 100ms)
  - [ ] 3.5 Verify no errors or conflicts
  - [ ] 3.6 Document results: sync latency, success rate

- [ ] 4.0 Test User Context and Attribution
  - [ ] 4.1 User A creates object via AI
  - [ ] 4.2 Verify object.createdBy === User A's ID
  - [ ] 4.3 User B creates object via AI
  - [ ] 4.4 Verify object.createdBy === User B's ID
  - [ ] 4.5 Check presence system shows correct creator names
  - [ ] 4.6 Document attribution accuracy (should be 100%)

- [ ] 5.0 Test Conflict Resolution
  - [ ] 5.1 Create a circle on canvas
  - [ ] 5.2 User A: "Move the circle to 300, 300"
  - [ ] 5.3 User B (immediately): "Move the circle to 400, 400"
  - [ ] 5.4 Verify last-write-wins (final position should be User B's)
  - [ ] 5.5 Test delete during update: User A deletes, User B updates → Verify delete wins
  - [ ] 5.6 Test different properties: User A moves, User B colors → Both changes apply
  - [ ] 5.7 Document conflict resolution behavior

- [ ] 6.0 Test State Synchronization
  - [ ] 6.1 User A creates object via AI
  - [ ] 6.2 User B: "Move the circle to 500, 500" (referencing User A's object)
  - [ ] 6.3 Verify User B's AI can see and reference User A's object
  - [ ] 6.4 Test ID-based targeting across users
  - [ ] 6.5 Verify getCanvasState returns up-to-date state for all users
  - [ ] 6.6 Document state sync accuracy

- [ ] 7.0 Performance Testing with 5+ Concurrent Users
  - [ ] 7.1 Setup 5 user accounts and browser windows
  - [ ] 7.2 All 5 users send AI commands within 10 seconds
  - [ ] 7.3 Measure AI response times for each user
  - [ ] 7.4 Measure object sync latency
  - [ ] 7.5 Check for any errors, crashes, or degradation
  - [ ] 7.6 Document performance metrics: response times, latency, error rate

- [ ] 8.0 Edge Case Testing
  - [ ] 8.1 Test: User A disconnects → User B continues using AI
  - [ ] 8.2 Test: User A refreshes page → Chat clears, canvas persists
  - [ ] 8.3 Test: Network lag simulation (Chrome DevTools 3G) → Verify sync still works
  - [ ] 8.4 Test: Bulk creation stress: User A creates 100 shapes, User B creates 100 shapes
  - [ ] 8.5 Document edge case handling and results

- [ ] 9.0 Create Test Report Document
  - [ ] 9.1 Create `docs/ai-multi-user-test-report.md`
  - [ ] 9.2 Document all test scenarios executed
  - [ ] 9.3 Record results: pass/fail, metrics, observations
  - [ ] 9.4 List any bugs or issues found
  - [ ] 9.5 Include performance benchmarks: sync latency, AI response times
  - [ ] 9.6 Add recommendations for improvements or fixes

- [ ] 10.0 Fix Critical Issues (If Any Found)
  - [ ] 10.1 Review test report for critical bugs
  - [ ] 10.2 Prioritize issues: critical, important, nice-to-have
  - [ ] 10.3 Fix critical issues (chat cross-contamination, attribution errors, sync failures)
  - [ ] 10.4 Re-test after fixes applied
  - [ ] 10.5 Update test report with fix results
