# Task List: Layer Management Panel Feature

## Relevant Files

- `src/features/objects/components/LayerPanel.tsx` - Create main layer panel container component
- `src/features/objects/components/LayerItem.tsx` - Create individual layer row component
- `src/features/objects/components/LayerPanelHeader.tsx` - Create panel header with title and controls

### Notes

- Panel positioned on right side of canvas (250-300px width)
- Visibility state stored in object.visible property (default: true)

## Implementation Complete ✅
All code for Layer Management Panel feature has been implemented:
- ✅ LayerPanel, LayerItem, LayerPanelHeader components created
- ✅ Visibility property added to CanvasObject type
- ✅ Visibility toggle functionality with real-time sync
- ✅ Layer selection (single and multi with Ctrl/Cmd+click)
- ✅ Canvas filters to render only visible objects
- ✅ Panel positioned on right side (280px width)
- ✅ Collapsed/expanded state saved to localStorage
- ✅ Layer names generated from object properties
- ✅ Empty state handling
Manual testing required to verify functionality.
