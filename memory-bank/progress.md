- âœ… Refactored to DRY architecture with useShapeInteractions hook
- âœ… Established patterns for future extensibility (AI agent, more shapes)
- âœ… Created Firebase security rules documentation

**Key Achievements:**
- ðŸŽ¯ Two shape types working (Rectangle and Circle)
- ðŸŽ¯ Real-time collaboration fully functional
- ðŸŽ¯ Clean, maintainable architecture ready for AI layer
- ðŸŽ¯ All interaction logic centralized in shared hook
- ðŸŽ¯ Performance optimized (throttled broadcasts, optimistic updates)

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Deploy to Vercel** - Make it publicly accessible
2. **Test with multiple users** - Validate real-world performance
3. **Benchmark performance** - Verify cursor/object sync latency targets
4. **Update security rules** - Switch from development to authenticated mode
5. **Document deployment** - Add deployment guide to README
