- canvasAction supports 5 operation types: create, update, delete, duplicate, arrange
- ID-based targeting pattern for reliable object manipulation
- Color translation (hex → color names) for better UX
- Conversational responses ("I created a red circle!" not "#ff0000")
- Direct OpenAI function calling (bypassed LangChain agent abstractions)
- Client-side execution using existing authenticated Firebase API
- Proper JSON Schema format for OpenAI tools
- AI chat UI with message history and real-time updates
- LangSmith tracing enabled for debugging
- **All 5 MVP features implemented and functional**
- Real-time cursor sync working across multiple users
- Real-time object drag and transform sync at 60fps
- Visual feedback for remote operations (opacity changes)
- Created useShapeInteractions hook eliminating code duplication
- Three shape types working: Rectangle, Circle, and Text
- Canvas pan/zoom with proper cursor feedback

## Next Steps: Phase 1 Implementation

### Ready to Build: Phase 1 Features (Canvas Improvements)
1. **Duplicate Object** - Add to objectsService.ts, Ctrl+D shortcut
2. **Copy/Paste** - Clipboard state, Ctrl+C/V shortcuts
3. **Multi-Object Selection** - Ctrl+click, foundation for layers and AI
4. **Right-Click Context Menu** - Property editor, common actions
5. **Layer Management Panel** - Sidebar with visibility toggles
6. **Undo/Redo** - History stack, Ctrl+Z/Y shortcuts

**Dependencies:** All Phase 1 features work with current single-canvas architecture

### Future: Phase 2 Features (Multi-LookBook Platform)
1. **My LookBooks** - Repository page, CRUD operations, routing changes
2. **LookBook Sharing** - Add Designers, Owner/Designer permissions
3. **Text Formatting** - Header/Subheading/Paragraph presets

**Dependencies:** Requires data model changes (LookBook metadata, new routing)

### Future: Phase 3 Features (AI Enhancements)
1. **AI Bulk Creation** - Up to 100 shapes instantly
2. **AI Space Evenly** - Equal distribution of selected objects
3. **AI Arrange Direction** - Horizontal/vertical layouts
4. **AI Create Styleguide** - Visual guidelines panel
5. **AI Multi-User Testing** - Validate concurrent AI usage
6. **AI Chat UX** - 2-line input, auto-expand

**Dependencies:** Requires multi-select (Phase 1), text formatting (Phase 2)

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Decisions
✅ **Technology Stack:** Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Konva.js + Zustand + Firebase  
✅ **Architecture:** Vertical slicing by feature  
✅ **State Management:** Zustand  
✅ **Conflict Resolution:** Last-write-wins with timestamps  
✅ **Database Strategy:** RTDB for ephemeral data, Firestore for persistence  
✅ **Canvas Library:** Konva.js  
✅ **Shape Types:** Rectangle and Circle (both implemented)  
✅ **Cursor Throttle:** 16ms (60fps)  
✅ **Object Persistence Debounce:** 300ms  
✅ **Transform Throttle:** 16ms (60fps)  
✅ **DRY Pattern:** useShapeInteractions hook for shared interaction logic  
✅ **Visual Feedback:** Opacity reduction (0.6) for remote transforms  

### Open Questions for Post-MVP
- Text shape implementation details (font, size, editing)?
- Line/arrow shape implementation?
- Multi-select implementation approach?
- Undo/redo strategy (local vs. synced)?
- AI agent command vocabulary and structure?
- LangSmith observability configuration?

### Considerations
- **Performance Validated:** Cursor and object sync working smoothly
- **Architecture Clean:** Ready for AI agent integration via useShapeInteractions
- **Extensibility:** New shapes can be added in ~30 lines of code
- **Security:** Currently in development mode, needs hardening before public launch
- **Deployment:** Ready for Vercel, just needs environment setup

## Blockers
None - All deployment issues resolved, AI Agent feature working and tested successfully

## Notes
- **MVP Complete:** All 5 core features functional
- **AI Agent Complete:** 10 command types implemented and tested locally
- **Firebase Project:** Configured and working (Auth, RTDB, Firestore)
- **OpenAI API Key:** Managed via localStorage or environment variable
- **Security Rules:** Deployed to Firebase (authentication required)
- **Shape Types:** Rectangle, Circle, and Text (all with real-time sync)
- **Performance Targets:** Need production validation with concurrent users
- **Next Phase:** Test AI Agent → Validate Performance → Polish → Advanced Features
