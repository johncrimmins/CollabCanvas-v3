## Recent Changes
- **AI Agent Tool Consolidation Complete ✅**
- Consolidated 10 tools into 2 core tools: getCanvasState and canvasAction
- canvasAction supports 5 operation types: create, update, delete, duplicate, arrange
- ID-based targeting pattern for reliable object manipulation
- Color translation (hex → color names) for better UX
- Conversational responses ("I created a red circle!" not "#ff0000")
- Direct OpenAI function calling (bypassed LangChain agent abstractions)
- Client-side execution using existing authenticated Firebase API
- Proper JSON Schema format for OpenAI tools
- AI chat UI with message history and real-time updates
- LangSmith tracing enabled for debugging
- **All 5 MVP features implemented and functional**
- Real-time cursor sync working across multiple users
- Real-time object drag and transform sync at 60fps
- Visual feedback for remote operations (opacity changes)
- Created useShapeInteractions hook eliminating code duplication
- Three shape types working: Rectangle, Circle, and Text
- Canvas pan/zoom with proper cursor feedback

## Next Steps: Deployment & Validation

### 1. Deployment (Current Priority) ✨
- **Deploy to Vercel** - Push to production
- **Configure environment variables** - Set up Firebase prod credentials
- **Test public URL** - Ensure app loads correctly
- **Monitor initial performance** - Check for any production issues

### 2. Multi-User Testing (High Priority)
- **Test with 2+ concurrent users** - Open multiple browser windows/devices
- **Validate cursor sync** - Should be <50ms latency
- **Validate object sync** - Should be <100ms latency
- **Test transform sync** - Verify resize/rotate appear smoothly
- **Check visual feedback** - Opacity changes when others transform
- **Test persistence** - Refresh and verify objects persist

### 3. Performance Benchmarking (High Priority)
- **Measure cursor latency** - Use console timestamps
- **Measure object sync latency** - Validate <100ms target
- **Test with 500+ objects** - Verify 60 FPS maintained
- **Test with 5+ users** - Validate scalability target
- **Monitor Firebase usage** - Check RTDB and Firestore quotas

### 4. Security Hardening (Before Public Launch)
- **Update Firestore security rules** - Require authentication
- **Update RTDB security rules** - User-specific access only
- **Test with Firebase Emulator** - Validate rules work correctly
- **Deploy security rules** - Push to production Firebase
- **Verify authenticated-only access** - Test with unauthenticated user

### 5. AI Agent Feature ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Direct OpenAI function calling (no agent executor)
- ✅ Proper JSON Schema format for all tools
- ✅ Client-side execution with authenticated Firebase API
- ✅ Tool execution confirmed working
- ✅ LangSmith observability enabled
- ✅ AI chat UI with message history
- ✅ OpenAI API key management (env var)
- ✅ Text shape support for complex layouts
- ✅ **2-TOOL ARCHITECTURE**:
  - getCanvasState: Query current canvas objects with IDs
  - canvasAction: Unified tool with 5 operations (create, update, delete, duplicate, arrange)
- ✅ ID-based targeting for reliable manipulation
- ✅ Color translation for natural language responses
- ✅ TypeScript compilation verified (no errors)
- **Status**: Consolidated architecture ready for testing
- **Next**: User testing with 2-tool workflow

## Active Decisions

### Resolved Decisions
✅ **Technology Stack:** Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Konva.js + Zustand + Firebase  
✅ **Architecture:** Vertical slicing by feature  
✅ **State Management:** Zustand  
✅ **Conflict Resolution:** Last-write-wins with timestamps  
✅ **Database Strategy:** RTDB for ephemeral data, Firestore for persistence  
✅ **Canvas Library:** Konva.js  
✅ **Shape Types:** Rectangle and Circle (both implemented)  
✅ **Cursor Throttle:** 16ms (60fps)  
✅ **Object Persistence Debounce:** 300ms  
✅ **Transform Throttle:** 16ms (60fps)  
✅ **DRY Pattern:** useShapeInteractions hook for shared interaction logic  
✅ **Visual Feedback:** Opacity reduction (0.6) for remote transforms  

### Open Questions for Post-MVP
- Text shape implementation details (font, size, editing)?
- Line/arrow shape implementation?
- Multi-select implementation approach?
- Undo/redo strategy (local vs. synced)?
- AI agent command vocabulary and structure?
- LangSmith observability configuration?

### Considerations
- **Performance Validated:** Cursor and object sync working smoothly
- **Architecture Clean:** Ready for AI agent integration via useShapeInteractions
- **Extensibility:** New shapes can be added in ~30 lines of code
- **Security:** Currently in development mode, needs hardening before public launch
- **Deployment:** Ready for Vercel, just needs environment setup

## Blockers
None - AI Agent feature working and tested successfully

## Notes
- **MVP Complete:** All 5 core features functional
- **AI Agent Complete:** 10 command types implemented and tested locally
- **Firebase Project:** Configured and working (Auth, RTDB, Firestore)
- **OpenAI API Key:** Managed via localStorage or environment variable
- **Security Rules:** Deployed to Firebase (authentication required)
- **Shape Types:** Rectangle, Circle, and Text (all with real-time sync)
- **Performance Targets:** Need production validation with concurrent users
- **Next Phase:** Test AI Agent → Validate Performance → Polish → Advanced Features
